==== how to program smart contract

- contracts - solidity / viper
- remix IDE (web IDE)
- solidity LSP (yakindu)
- solidity language server

- LSP decouples language from editor
- based on json-rpc
- Eclipse LSP4J
- theia lsp solidity (npm package -> start LS when file is opened)
- server world is misleading (2 process on the same machine / same filesytem)
- LSP to xtext

== Tools for shrinking your containers

- dietitian
- fat / help
- "fat" is bad for software (difficult to deploy)
- TOFI (why is my container TOFI)
- banana / gorilla taken bannana
- vulnerability
- microcontainers (single execution)

==== Container pattern -> builder pattern

Do Not Do This! Hard to maintain

==== Multistage build

==== Squash (experimental)

==== Smith tool (created by Oracle)

from scratch ?

== Developer centric IoT Platforms

== Adding support for new languages / Dart

==== What is LSP

- M languages x N editors -> do not reinvent the wheel (bi-directional)
- Client -> Server (term misleading - on local machine, no privacy concerns)
- based on notifications
- LSP is growing - http://langsserver.org
- syntax highlighting not done by LSP
- Dart
- syntax colouring LSP issue
