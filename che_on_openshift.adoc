= Openshift Connector for Eclipse Che

Currently, the main thing that blocks integration is

image::images/che-on-openshift/spi-imp.png[width="500", height="700",aption="SPI Implementation"]

Plan:

1. have initial impl merged to che "openshift-connector" branch

2. implement all OS connector methods

3. define SPI

4. refactor OS connector for using SPI

Epic Jira for the 1st item from the plan - https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CHE-26[Use K8S API to create Che workspaces]

NOTE: working on item *3* could start before *2* is completed

== Workflow

Currently all OpenShift & Che integration happens in Mario's fork - https://github.com/l0rd/che 
First thing, make sure that you can build `openshift-connector` branch:

```
cd che/

git remote add mario git@github.com:l0rd/che.git
git fetch mario openshift-connector:openshift-connector
git checkout openshift-connector

mvn -Dskip-enforce -Dskip-validate-sources -DskipTests -Dfindbugs.skip -Dgwt.compiler.localWorkers=2 -T 1C -Dskip-validate-sources clean install 
```

== How to deploy Eclipse Che on Minishift ?

Pre-requirements:

- OpenShift CLI (`oc`) - `v1.2.2` and above
- Minishift (`minishift`) - `v0.9.0` and above

First 4 steps are identical to the ones described in https://github.com/l0rd/openche#deployment-of-che-on-minishift[Deployment of Che on Minishift] document.
