= Openshift Connector for Eclipse Che

Current plan for OpenShift integration to Che project:

1) Provide PR with initial OpenShift connector implementation to Che project

2) Implement all OpenShift connector methods

3) Define SPI

4) Refactor OpenShift Connector for using SPI

NOTE: working on item *3* could start before *2* is completed.

NOTE: Epic jira for the *1st* item from the plan - https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CHE-26[Use K8S API to create Che workspaces]

== Workflow

For now all initial OpenShift & Che integration work is happening in Mario's fork - https://github.com/l0rd/che

Once 11 remaining issues from https://issues.jboss.org/browse/CHE-26[Use K8S API to create Che workspaces] are fixed we will be ready to provide PR with initial OpenShift inegration to Che project.

First thing, make sure that you can build `openshift-connector` branch:

```
cd che/

git remote add mario git@github.com:l0rd/che.git
git fetch mario openshift-connector:openshift-connector
git checkout openshift-connector

mvn -Dskip-enforce -Dskip-validate-sources -DskipTests -Dfindbugs.skip -Dgwt.compiler.localWorkers=2 -T 1C -Dskip-validate-sources clean install
```

NOTE: For now PRs are expected to be provided against Mario's fork `openshift-connector` branch
