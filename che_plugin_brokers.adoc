== Existing plug-ins

Following are the existing types of plug-ins that are currently supported by Che:

* Che Editor plug-in
** Provides an editor or IDE that runs as a sidecar. Example: `Theia`, `Dirigible`, `Jupyter Notebook`.
* Che plug-in
** Sidecar container that provides additional functionality. Example: The `che-machine-exec-plugin` that provides terminal capabilities.
* VS Code extension plug-in
** Sidecar container that provides the functionality of an existing vscode extension. Example: https://www.sonarlint.org/vscode/[sonarlint]. This container can also be run in the main `Theia` container.
* Theia plug-in
** Sidecar container that extends the functionality of the Che-Theia editor. It can also run in the main `Theia` container.

[id='plugin-registry']
== Plug-in registry

The plug-in registry is a standalone service that provides the metadata for the available plug-ins. All the plug-ins are available via the plug-in registry.

[NOTE]
====
*https://che-plugin-registry.openshift.io* is used as the default plug-in registry. You can override it using the `++CHE_WORKSPACE_PLUGIN__REGISTRY__URL++` environment variable and specify a custom plug-in registry with custom set of plug-ins. Set this environment variable to 'NULL' if plug-in tooling is not required.
====

During workspace creation, this metadata is used by the Che sever and exposed via the *User Dashboard* for plug-in picking.

image::images/che-plugin-brokers/plugins.png[width="1640", height="460",aption="Plugin Selection via User Dashboard"]

[NOTE]
====
You can select only one Che editor plug-in and multiple Che, VS Code, Theia plug-ins. The Che, VS Code, and Theia plug-in functionality depends on the selection of the Che editor plug-in. For instance, the VS Code plug-in does not provide additional functionality in the Jupyter Notebook because the editor does not honour this plug-in type. But, the Theia IDE editor supports both VS Code extension and Theia plug-ins. Currently, there is no smart validation of plug-in selection based on the editor type.
====

The most important information that the plug-in registry provides to the Che server is the `type` of the plug-in (example: VS Code extension) and the link to the `meta.yaml` file.

The `containerImage` attribute specifies the image that is used for running the plug-in as a sidecar container. If the `containerImage` attribute is not specified, the plug-in runs inside the main Theia container.

[id='plugin-brokers']
== Plugin brokers

The *Plugin Broker* application runs immediately prior to the workspace start phase. Based on the received plug-in metadata, the *Plugin Broker* application delivers the plug-in binaries to the workspace containers. It sends workspace configuration changes to the Che server. These configuration changes should be applied before the workspace is started.

Each plug-in must be processed differently and hence there are multiple types of plug-ins and brokers.

* The Che plug-in broker for the Che plug-in and the Che editor types
* The VS Code extension broker for the VS Code extension plug-in type
* The Theia plug-in broker for the Theia plug-in type

For implementation details and differences in the existing plug-in brokers, see the `README.MD` file of the dedicated https://github.com/eclipse/che-plugin-broker[che-plugin-broker] repository.

Since Che supports pluggable editor implementations (Theia, Dirigible, Jupyter Notebook), the new plug-in types with dedicated brokers will be part of future releases. Example: The Dirigible plug-in and the corresponding Dirigible plug-in broker.  

[id='plugin-broker-lifecycle']
=== Plugin broker lifecycle

The following is a schematic diagram of the plug-in broker lifecycle:

image::images/che-plugin-brokers/plugin_broker_lifecycle.png[width="800", height="560",aption="Plugin Broker Lifecycle"]

The following are the phases in the plug-in broker lifecycle:

. Before the actual workspace startup, the Che server makes a request to the Che plug-in registry to obtain the metadata of the plug-ins that are added to the workspace.

. The Che plug-in registry provides metadata of the plug-ins to the Che server.

. Based on the plug-ins' `type` attributes, the Che server decides the plug-in brokers that must be run before the workspace startup. There is 1:1 https://github.com/eclipse/che/blob/master/infrastructures/openshift/src/main/java/org/eclipse/che/workspace/infrastructure/openshift/OpenShiftInfraModule.java#L152-L170[mapping] between the plug-in's type and the corresponding plug-in broker in the Che server image.

  }

[NOTE]
====
The 1:1 mapping approach  between the plug-in type and the plug-in broker implementation on the Che server side may change in the future. To make Che more extendable and to provide the possibility of creating custom plug-ins with dedicated brokers, the picking of the broker may be moved to the Che plug-in registry in the upcoming releases. This will allow users to override not only the plug-ins but also the plug-in broker implementation.
====
+
. After the required brokers are identified, the Che server starts the plug-in brokers one by one in the Kubernetes or OpenShift namespace where the workspace will be created. It waits for the response from the plug-in broker.
+
image::images/che-plugin-brokers/vs_code_plugin_broker_pod.png[width="1640", height="150",aption="VS Code Plugin Broker Pod"]
+
Based on the metadata provided by the Che server, the plug-in broker performs the following actions:

* Downloads and unpacks the plug-in files (binaries/configuration) if needed.

* Copies the plug-in files to a workspace if needed.

* Finds or generates the workspace configuration changes if needed for a plug-in.
+
. The plug-in broker sends the workspace configuration changes back to the Che server. These workspace configuration changes must be applied before the workspace startup (example: adding environment variables, volumes, editor commands, etc.). To make the workspace start process more verbose, the plug-in broker also sends the logs and the errors of the various process stages.
