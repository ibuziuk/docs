== What are plugin brokers in general (why plugin brokers are needed) ?

Che has devPlugin brokers. The purpose of devPlugin brokers is to handle a specific way to install a devPlugin into Che. There are several type of devPlugins that can run on different editors and may be packaged differently. So each cases requires a specific installation.
At the moment, according to the `type` metadata of the devPlugin, Che would start the right broker and process the specific installation process.
We have these below devPlugin types and each of them has a broker implementation:

- Che-VSCode plug-in
    - Sidecar containers
    - A reference to a vscode extension (in the market place)
- Che plug-in
    - Sidecar containers
    - Editor commands
- Theia plug-in
    - A .theia file with
        - The plugin on a che-theia editor
        - Optionally sidecars container
- Editor plug-in
    - A containers with a web app (editor)
    - Sidecar containers

Each type of plugin have a corresponding broker. Broker install process for each type is describe here: https://github.com/eclipse/che-plugin-broker/blob/master/README.md 


==== Theia supports several types of plugins including VSCode extensions. It could add support of new plugin types in future
==== Since Che 7 supports plugable editor implementations we should have an ability to add broker of plugins suitable for a new editor
==== It is possible to also implement plugins for other plugins

== What plugin brokers can do and how they work ?

==== Download binaries and configuration of editors/plugins
==== Generate configuration of editors/plugins including sidecars
==== Unpack files in it is needed for them to be consumed by an editor
==== Send logs of stages of its work to Workspace master to make workspace start more verbose to show why a user waits
==== Send error if something goes wrong
